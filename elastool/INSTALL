**Installation Methods:**

1. **Using pip:**
   To easily install the latest version of ElasTool, simply execute the command:
   `pip install -U elastool`

2. **Direct Installation from GitHub:**
   - First, clone or download the ElasTool package from the GitHub repository (make sure to use the actual link).
   - Then navigate to the downloaded directory and run:
   `pip install .`
   Note the "dot" symbol, which is crucial.

3. **Installation on Restricted Systems:**
   If you are working on a more restrictive system where options 1 and 2 are not suitable, the following packages are required:
   - Python 3.5 or later.
   - NumPy.
   - Spglib.
   - ASE.
   - Pandas.

   These libraries can be installed with either pip or conda. If you do not have pip or conda installed already in your system, follow the guidelines below:

   - **Installing Conda:**
     To install the full Anaconda distribution, issue the command: `conda install anaconda`. Alternatively, you can download your system-specific type directly from the Anaconda website and follow the instructions therein at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install. For a minimal installation of Conda, consider miniconda at the website: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.

   - **Installing Pip on CentOS:**
     1. Download pip with: `curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"`
     2. Install pip with: `sudo python get-pip.py`
     3. Verify the version with: `pip -V`

   - **Installing Pip on Ubuntu:**
     1. First, update your repository with: `sudo apt update`
     2. Install pip with: `sudo apt install python3-pip`
     3. Verify the version: `pip3 --version`
     4. You can upgrade to the latest version with: `sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip`

   - **Installing Python 3:**
     - Method 1: `conda update anaconda` followed by `conda install python=3.XX` (XX is the version of the Python3, e.g., Python3.5)
     - Method 2: If you still use Python 2: 
       1. `conda update anaconda`
       2. `conda create --name py3 python=3.XX`
       3. `conda activate py3` to activate Python3
       4. `conda deactivate` to deactivate an active environment

   - **Installing Other Libraries:**
     - NumPy:  `conda install -c anaconda numpy`
     - Spglib: `conda install -c conda-forge spglib`
     - ASE:    `conda install -c conda-forge ase`
     - Pandas: `conda install pandas` (To specify a version, use `conda install pandas=0.20.3`)

**Final Installation Step:**
After installing the prerequisites, in the main directory, execute:
`python setup.py install [--prefix=/path/to/install/]`
Note: The "--prefix" could be needed if you're running on a shared HPC where you might not have admin privileges.
