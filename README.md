ElasTool is an automated Python-based toolkit for calculating the second-order elastic constants (SOECs) of any crystal systems belonging to two- and three-dimensional. It utilizes three kinds of strain-matrix sets, the high-efficiency strain-matrix sets (OHESS) [1], the universal linear-independent coupling strains (ULICS) [2] and the all-single-element strain-matrix sets (ASESS) [1] to automatically calculate the SOECs. Elastool is very flexibible and has the capability of accurately determine the elastic constant and mechanical properties of materials at both zero-temperature and/or finite temperature and pressure. 

Presently, ElasTool interfaces to VASP package for calculating the accurate stresses of strained crystal. But the interfaces to other DFT packages can also be easily implemented.
